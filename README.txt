Automatic Nodetitle Module
------------------------
by Wolfgang Ziegler, nuppla@zites.net


Description
-----------
This is a small and efficent module that allows hiding of the node title field. To prevent
empty node title fields it sets the title to the content type name or to an configurable
string. If the token module is installled it's possible to use various node data for the
autogenerated title - e.g. use the text of a CCK field.

Advanced users can also provide some PHP code, that is used for automatically generating an
appropriate title.

Installation 
------------
 * (optional) Download and install the token module.
 * Copy the module's directory to your modules directory and activate the module.
 * Activate it for some content-types at 'admin/settings/content-types'.
 
 
 
 
 Advanced Use: Combining tokens and PHP
 ---------------------------------------
 
 You can combine php evalution with the token module, because tokens are replaced first.
 Here is an example:
 
<?php
  $token = '[field_testtext-raw]';
  if (empty($token)) {
    return '[type]';
  }
  else {
    return $token;
  } 
?>
 
 So if the text of the CCK textfield [field_testtext-raw] isn't empty it will be used as title.
 Otherwise the node type will be used.
 
 
 Advanced Use: Accessing $node from PHP
 ----------------------------------------
 If you prefer to not use the token module, the best way to access $node is:
 
<?php
  global $form_values;
  $node = (array)$form_values;
..
?>
However, the node does just contain the form_values as submitted by the user. Any data
processing the modules might do with their fields will be done later.
For sure it's easier to go with the token module!
