Automatic Title Module
------------------------
by Wolfgang Ziegler, nuppla@zites.net


Description
-----------
This is a small and efficent module that allows hiding of the content title field in the form.
To prevent empty content title fields it sets the title to the content type name or to an
configurable string. It is possible to use various content data for the autogenerated title,
e.g. the token [current-user:name] is going to be replaced with the currently logged in
users name. If the token module is installed, a list of possible replacement patterns
will be shown.

Installation
------------
 * (optional) Download and install the token module in order to get token
   replacement help.
 * Copy the module's directory to your modules directory and activate the module.
 * For each content type you want to have an automatic title, configure the
   module at 'admin/structure/types'.

Note
-----
 Due to the way the module works, it is not possible to make use of some replacement
 tokens that are not available before the content is saved the first time, e.g.
 [node:nid].


 Updating titles from existing nodes
 -----------------------------------
 If you set the title to be auto generated for some content type, existing nodes
 are not affected. You can update existing nodes by going to 'admin/content',
 then filter for your content type, mark the nodes and choose "Update option"
 "Update automatic titles".
