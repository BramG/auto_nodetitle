Automatic Nodetitle Module
------------------------
by Wolfgang Ziegler, nuppla@zites.net


Description
-----------
This is a small and efficent module that allows hiding of the node title field. To prevent
empty node title fields it sets the title to the content type name or to an configurable
string. If the token module is installled it's possible to use various node data for the
autogenerated title - e.g. use the text of a CCK field.

Advanced users can also provide some PHP code, that is used for automatically generating an
appropriate title.


Installation 
------------
 * (optional) Download and install the token module.
 * Copy the module's directory to your modules directory and activate the module.
 * Activate it for some content-types at 'admin/settings/content-types'.
